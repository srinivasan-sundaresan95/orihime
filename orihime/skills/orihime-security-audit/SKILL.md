# Orihime Security Audit Skill

## Trigger conditions

- "Run a security audit on [repo]"
- "Find SQL injection / XSS / injection risks"
- "Check taint paths in [repo]"
- "Any OWASP issues in [repo]?"
- "What can an attacker reach from a public endpoint?"
- "Find injection vulnerabilities"
- "Show me the security findings for [repo]"
- "Check license compliance for [repo]"

---

## Step 1 — Enumerate all entry points

```
mcp__orihime__find_entry_points(repo_name="<repo>")
```

Entry points include:
- HTTP handlers (`@GetMapping`, `@PostMapping`, etc.)
- Kafka consumers (`@KafkaListener`)
- Scheduled tasks (`@Scheduled`)
- JMS/RabbitMQ listeners

Note the total count — this is the attack surface.

---

## Step 2 — Find reachable taint sinks (entry-point filtered)

```
mcp__orihime__find_reachable_sinks(repo_name="<repo>")
```

This is the S8-filtered view: only sinks reachable from real entry points via CALLS paths.
Suppresses dead-code and internal-utility false positives (typically 30–50% reduction).

When to use unfiltered instead (user asks "all sinks" or "unfiltered"):
```
mcp__orihime__find_taint_sinks(repo_name="<repo>")
```

---

## Step 3 — Value-flow taint (stricter, argument-level)

```
mcp__orihime__find_taint_flows(repo_name="<repo>")
```

Returns only findings where a tainted argument (@RequestParam/@RequestBody/@PathVariable)
flows directly into a known sink's first parameter via a CALLS edge.
This is stricter than find_reachable_sinks — fewer results, higher confidence.
Use both: reachable_sinks for breadth, taint_flows for high-confidence findings.

---

## Step 4 — Cross-service taint paths

```
mcp__orihime__find_cross_service_taint(repo_name="<repo>")
```

Taint paths where untrusted HTTP input crosses a service boundary — e.g. Service A's
request parameter flows to Service B's SQL sink via a REST call.
Higher severity because they bypass per-service input validation.

---

## Step 5 — Second-order injection

```
mcp__orihime__find_second_order_injection(repo_name="<repo>")
```

Detects patterns where user-controlled data is stored to DB (save/persist/merge)
and then read back and used as a sink (query/execute). This is a structural
approximation — use for prioritizing manual review, not as definitive findings.

---

## Step 6 — Generate framework-mapped report

```
mcp__orihime__generate_security_report(repo_name="<repo>", framework="owasp")
```

Framework options: `owasp`, `cwe`, `pci`, `stig`

OWASP result keys: `category`, `caller_fqn`, `sink_method`, `file_path`, `line_start`
CWE result keys: `cwe_id`, `caller_fqn`, `sink_method`, `file_path`, `line_start`
PCI result keys: `requirement`, `caller_fqn`, `sink_method`, `file_path`
STIG result keys: `vuln_id`, `caller_fqn`, `sink_method`, `file_path`

---

## Step 7 — License compliance (if requested)

```
mcp__orihime__find_license_violations(repo_name="<repo>")
```

Reads pom.xml / build.gradle from the repo root, queries Maven Central for each
dependency's SPDX license. Returns only VIOLATION and WARNING items (OK items filtered).

Result keys: `group`, `artifact`, `version`, `license`, `status`, `reason`
Status values: `VIOLATION` (GPL/AGPL/LGPL found), `WARNING` (unknown/ambiguous), `UNKNOWN`

---

## Step 8 — Verify active security config

```
mcp__orihime__list_security_config()
```

Shows the merged built-in + user-defined rules currently in effect. Use this if
results seem missing or unexpected — confirm the expected sources/sinks are loaded.

---

## Mapping sink types to OWASP categories

| Sink type | OWASP category |
|---|---|
| SQL query construction (execute, executeQuery) | A03 — Injection |
| JPQL/HQL string concat (createQuery) | A03 — Injection |
| `Runtime.exec()` / ProcessBuilder | A03 — Injection (command) |
| HttpServletResponse.sendRedirect | A01 — Open Redirect |
| File path construction (readAllBytes, newBufferedReader) | A01 — Path Traversal |
| WebClient/RestTemplate exchange | A10 — SSRF |
| Cross-service taint | A01/A03 + cross-boundary |

---

## Presenting findings

```
## Security Audit — [repo_name]

### Attack Surface
- Entry points: N (HTTP: X, Kafka: Y, Scheduled: Z)

### Findings Summary (S8 reachability-filtered)
| OWASP Category | Findings |
|---|---|
| A03 — Injection | X |
| A10 — SSRF | Y |

### Value-Flow Taint (high confidence)
- N findings where tainted args flow directly to sinks

### Cross-Service Taint
- N paths crossing service boundaries (higher severity)

### Second-Order Injection Candidates
- N structural candidates for manual review

### License Violations
- N violations (GPL/AGPL/LGPL detected)

### Top HIGH Findings
[List caller_fqn → sink_method @ file:line]
```

---

## Gotchas

### find_reachable_sinks vs find_taint_sinks
Always use `find_reachable_sinks` for a normal audit. Only fall back to `find_taint_sinks`
when the user explicitly wants unfiltered results OR when `find_reachable_sinks` returns
zero (which may mean the S8 pass hasn't run for this repo — re-index to fix).

### find_taint_flows is NOT a superset of find_reachable_sinks
`find_taint_flows` is stricter: it only catches arg-pos=0 flows. It can miss injection
paths where the tainted value is passed as the second argument. Always run both.

### Do NOT read source files
This skill uses MCP tools only. All findings are in the graph.
